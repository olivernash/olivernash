I'm a researcher in AI policy and collective intelligence, and a director at the [Institute for the Future of Work (IFOW)](https://www.ifow.org). My work focuses on the intersection of **AI**, **public policy**, and **collective intelligence**, with a particular focus on **AI governance**, **labour market impacts**, **systemic risks** and **skills development**.

## Current Focus
- **AI Policy & Regulation:** Analysing the impact of generative AI on the labour market, with a focus on governance frameworks and collective intelligence.
- **Future of Work:** Exploring how automation and technology can shape inclusive labour markets and create better pathways for workers.
- **Ethical Technology Development:** Researching privacy-preserving technologies, algorithmic governance, and the societal implications of AI adoption.

## Featured Projects
- **[Flourish](https://ifow.org):** A skills platform helping individuals and organisations navigate green job pathways, supported by research from the Pissarides Review.
- **[Assembly](https://github.com/olivernash/assembly):** A deliberative platform for addressing complex policy challenges through collective intelligence and participatory governance.
- **[Collective Analytics](https://github.com/olivernash/collective-analytics):** A tool leveraging natural language processing and machine learning to analyse collective decision-making.
