I'm a researcher in AI policy and collective intelligence, and a director at the [Institute for the Future of Work (IFOW)](https://www.ifow.org). My work focuses on the intersection of **AI**, **public policy**, and **collective intelligence**, with a particular focus on **AI governance**, **labour market impacts**, **systemic risks** and **skills development**.

## Current focus areas
- **AI Policy:** Analysing the impact of frontier AI on the labour market and work, with a focus on socio-technical governance frameworks and collective intelligence.
- **Future of Work:** Exploring how AI and automation is impacting work, workers and the labour market.
- **Responsible AI:** Researching privacy-preserving technologies, algorithmic governance, and the societal implications of AI adoption.
